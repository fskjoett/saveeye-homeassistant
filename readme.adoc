# Saveeye Homeassistant

Saveye is a device that uses impulses of light to measure the amount of electricity used in your energy meter. It is available from https://saveeye.dk. 

It has support for MQTT but the documentation from https://saveeye.dk/mqtt is quite sparse thus I created this repo to help others get started. 

It is still very much a work in progress - PR's and issues are welcome.

## Setup

Follow the guide at https://saveeye.dk/mqtt to get your Saveeye device setup with MQTT.

## Homeassistant MQTT Sensors

The basic config to get sensors in Homeassistant to capture current Watt and total Wh is as follows:

```yaml
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: saveeye_currentConsumptionWatt
      unique_id: saveeye_currentConsumptionWatt
      state_topic: "saveeye/telemetry"
      value_template: "{{value_json.currentConsumptionWatt}}"
      device_class: power
      unit_of_measurement: W
      state_class: measurement
    - name: saveeye_totalConsumptionWh
      unique_id: saveeye_totalConsumptionWh
      state_topic: "saveeye/telemetry"
      value_template: "{{value_json.totalConsumptionWh}}"
      device_class: energy
      unit_of_measurement: "Wh"
      state_class: total_increasing
```

### Additional Sensors

The following additional sensors are available from the Saveeye device. I'm not including them by default as haven't fonud something to use them for yet:

```yaml
    - name: saveeye_pulses
      state_topic: "saveeye/telemetry"
      value_template: "{{value_json.pulses}}"
    - name: saveeye_latestInterval
      state_topic: "saveeye/telemetry"
      value_template: "{{value_json.latestInterva}}"
    - name: saveeye_timeSinceLatestPulse
      state_topic: "saveeye/telemetry"
      value_template: "{{value_json.timeSinceLatestPulse}}"
```
